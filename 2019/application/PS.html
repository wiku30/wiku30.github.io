<h2>Personal  Statement: UIUC ISE PhD</h2>
Zishuo Zhao 
<p>Since  middle school, I have always been interested in mathematics and its  applications in computer science. I initially entered Department of Computer  Science and Technology, Tsinghua University with a silver medal in CMO&rsquo;14 and a  first prize in NOIP&rsquo;13, and from middle school I am especially interested in  geometry and combinatorics, which has built up a preliminary background for my  current interests. At that time I said, while contests of MO and OI are quite  different from each other, the fields of math and computer science are like the  rain and the sunshine; when standing hand in hand, they will form into a wide  and rainbow-colored world.</p>
<p>I  entered IIIS in Spring 2016. The early times in Department of CST helped me  strengthen my fundamental understanding in computer science; after entering  IIIS, as I decided to take more courses than required to make more variety in  my knowledge background, I found myself doing better in courses in connection  with mathematics than those about coding, and then gradually developed my  research interest in the general direction: whatever combines mathematics and  computer science, especially in computational geometry, computer  graphics/vision/robotics and learning theory.</p>
<p>In  Spring 2018, on the visiting program to UT Austin, I did research in the field  of data-driven topological reconstruction under the supervision of Qixing Huang  and Chandrajit Bajaj. During the visiting program, my supervisors let me learn  by exploring instead of lead my way, so I gained much understanding about  dictionary learning, information theory, non-convex optimization and etc.  Although I came across much difficulty and did not achieve substantial results,  it did make an unusual experience and provided me with understandings of  scientific research as my first experience as a researcher. </p>
<p>After  coming back, I did research on dynamic scene SLAM in the Graphics Lab of  Tsinghua, under the supervision of Shi-Min Hu. In that project, I observed a  fact that landmarks on a rigid body has constant pairwise distances, and  contributed in the concept of motion similarity matrix and rigidity constraints  for clustering, which improved both the accuracy and efficiency of the  state-of-the-art semantic clustering algorithm. The paper, <em>ClusterSLAM: A  SLAM Backend for Simultaneous Rigid Body Clustering and Motion Estimation</em>,  has been accepted for ICCV 2019. Inspired of the fancy effects and potential of  rigidity properties, I finished my Bachelor Thesis <em>Noise-Stable Rigid Graphs  for Euclidean Embedding</em>, which got an A grade.</p>
<p>From  Fall 2019, I have been seeking for opportunities to find real-world  applications of the computational geometry and optimization in a wide range of  areas, and now I am on an internship in the MSC lab of UC Berkeley, doing  research on point-cloud-based mapping and localization, which can contribute to  the autonomous driving system. I am still working on this project, trying to  develop a robust algorithm that combines GPS and IMU/Lidar data and realizes  robust and accurate real-time localization. During the experiments, I am  confronted with an issue that while practical navigation usually need global  maps, large-scale point cloud maps take huge memory spaces and have poor time  efficiency. Thus, I came up with an idea to replace the global map with an  Atlas of local maps with topological connections and do online inter-map  relocalization on edges of them, which I am still working on.</p>
<p>With  research experiences in a wide range of fields, I have gained opportunities to  look into computer vision from different perspectives, and get convinced that  it is inherently a geometric and algorithmic problem. In my view, the eventual  goal of vision problems is to gather information from partial noisy  observations and infer the underlying geometric structures, with an algorithm  economical with resources of samples, storage and computational power. While  the current trend of deep learning makes competent tools for data-driven  optimization, the black-box system in turn needs more explanation and  optimization itself. In my belief, we need to incorporate tools of  computational geometry, information theory, learning theory and algorithm  design to achieve a &ldquo;closed-form solution&rdquo; to computer vision problems.  Although such a revolutionary progress is probably beyond the reach at this  moment, I would enthusiastically expand my horizons and do more solid research  to close the gap.</p>
<p>As  I have made a good foundation for academic research during the first two years  in college, I am currently making my way and getting fulfilling progress for  academic research. As a future PhD student at UIUC ISE, I am interested in, but  not restricted to, the fields of computer graphics, vision and autonomous  driving. I would love to cherish the opportunity to enter the new field of  Operations Research under the supervision of Professor <strong>Yuan Zhou </strong>and  learn more solid knowledge on optimization, while contribute in fields with  both practical value and mathematical aesthetics with new inspiring methods, with  my eventual dream to combine different fields, and make creative work with new  inspiring perspectives towards those areas we have always been concerned on.</p>
