<p>Due to the current stress and anticipated challenges in my academic career, my homepage is temporarily unavailable. Updates will be provided as my situation evolves. </p>
<p>I would NOT be on the job market in the academic year of 2024-2025 as previously indicated. I may anticipate to graduate in 2027, depending on my research progress.<br><br>
  
  To friends who might be curious about the situation: I am aware that my research work is generally weak in a competitive environment. Despite this, I am willingly taking a few years to explore some starry-eyed projects that I am passionate about. This is a highly risky move as a senior PhD candidate, so I am currently refraining from most social activities unless absolutely necessary to maintain a calm and focused mind. <br><br>
  
  Estimated time before re-open: ~3 years.<br><br>
