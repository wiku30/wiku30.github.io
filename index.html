Due to the current stress and anticipated challenges in my academic career, my homepage is temporarily unavailable. Updates will be provided as my situation evolves. <br><br>

To friends who might be curious about the situation: I am aware that my research work is generally weak in a competitive environment. Despite this, I am willingly taking a few years to explore some starry-eyed projects that I am passionate about. This is a highly risky move as a senior PhD candidate, so I am currently refraining from most social activities unless absolutely necessary to maintain a calm and focused mind. <br><br>
