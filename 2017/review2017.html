	<font size="4"><span lang="en-us">times I wonder 
	how it feels to keep rushing across dreamlands and reality, but in 2017, my second year in IIIS, my life was exactly in this way. </span>

	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 8px">
	<font face="Calibri Light" size="4"><span lang="en-us">It is sometimes 
	hard to say what I have gained or lost, because they often play like two 
	sides of a coin. I failed to get a prize in the MCM competition, but the 
	experience to learn and work so much within short time made it possible to 
	face following challenges in two semesters. It is sometime difficult to 
	identify what my &quot;wishes&quot; are, but it is clear that most of my decisions are 
	made based on those wishes. Beyond every horizon, probably, lies something I have 
	been always looking for.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 8px"><span lang="en-us">
	<font face="Calibri Light" size="4">However, even though a variety of 
	precious events take place around me now and then, it is destined that only 
	a few of them can be associated with my further way. At that very point, it was high time to 
	move on and start getting onto my own timeline. Having got through all the 
	confusion and hesitation, I did it; and in the future, most importantly, I shall 
	hold on to my initial dreams and strive for the best, as 
	the main theme of 2018.</font></span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 8px"><span lang="en-us">
	<font face="Calibri Light" size="4">Beside the decision of future 
	research area, passing GRE and TOEFL at first attempts within a single 
	semester is another relieving achievement. For other parts of life, some 
	minor events also added to the meaning of the year. That aery trip on Line 5 
	across the skyline completed a long-cherished wish; and the work on some 
	unfamiliar areas, including music recognition and energy allocation, opened 
	up my eyes for a peek of another dimension.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 8px"><span lang="en-us">
			<font face="Calibri Light" size="4">In conclusion, it was a 
			totally fulfilling year in my college life. Yet, I should 
			remind myself: without further hard work in 2018, all 
			preliminary things done in 2017 will be rendered meaningless. 
			Therefore, it was not time to talk about accomplishments --- it was 
			only the beginning of everything.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 8px"><span lang="en-us">
<font face="Calibri Light" size="4">The year of 2018 is well worth expecting. It 
is time to keep moving on --- and it always is.</font></span></p>
