\section{Research Interests}

I am a fourth-year PhD student in UIUC, majoring in operations research,
and currently doing research in mechanism design. In general, my research
interests span a wide scope related to algorithm and mechanism design for
emerging applications in internet economics, including blockchain systems,
e-commerce, ridesharing platforms and so on. I am also interested in data-driven
mechanism design based on statistical/online learning.

On a very high level, my (starry-eyed) dream for research lies in the following fields, which are also the two projects I am most actively working on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI for mechanism design}: e.g., dynamic auction design based on online learning;
    \item \textbf{Mechanism design for AI}: e.g., incentive-secure design for proof-of-learning mechanisms in blockchain systems.
\end{itemize}
