\section*{Research Statement}

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in UIUC, majoring in operations research. I have a special interest in the mechanism design for blockchain and decentralized AI, with a \textcolor[rgb]{0.5,0.5,1}{(starry-eyed) dream} \iDM~ on the exploration of the design and theoretical boundaries of \textbf{decentralized trustworthy AI} platforms, for a general scope of reliability and social sustainability in AI and digital economy, including (particularly) the current concern and initiative of \textbf{AI safety} for the upcoming AGI era.

Particularly, I am recently interested in the exploration into a novel paradigm of \emph{incentive security}
on blockchain and AI platforms, which aims to combine game-theoretic and systematic/cryptographic methodologies
to prevent dishonest behavior of \emph{untrusted but rational} parties.

My current research topics span the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI for mechanism design~\A4M}: e.g., using data-driven methods to 
    improve the performance of economic platforms.
    \item \textbf{Mechanism design for AI~\M4A}: e.g., using economic incentives to 
    reinforce the efficiency and reliability of AI systems, especially on decentralized platforms.
    \item \textbf{Sustainability in AI \& Economy~\SUS}: e.g., using interdisciplinary
    methodologies to foster long-term social welfare and environmental friendliness
    for new-era AI and economic platforms. 
\end{itemize}

Additionally, I was interested in geometry-based computer vision (Visual SLAM in particular) at
my undergraduate times. Although I no longer focus on that research field, I am
still happy to discuss about related topics, especially the recently fruitful field of
Embodied AI~\EAI.
