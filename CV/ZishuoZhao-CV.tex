\section{Research Statement}

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in UIUC, majoring in operations research,
and currently doing research in mechanism design. In general, my research
interests span a wide scope related to incentive-aware design and optimization for
emerging applications in digital economy, including blockchain systems,
e-commerce, ridesharing platforms and so on. I am also interested in data-driven
mechanism design based on statistical/online learning, and topics in cryptography 
and distributed systems with applications in blockchain.

Particularly, I am recently interested in the exploration into a novel paradigm of \emph{incentive security}
on blockchain and AI platforms, which aims to combine game-theoretic and systematic/cryptographic methodologies
to prevent dishonest behavior of \emph{untrusted but rational} parties, for a general scope of reliability and social sustainability in AI and economy, including (particularly) the current concern and initiative of \textbf{AI Safety} for the upcoming AGI era.

On a high level, my \textcolor[rgb]{0.5,0.5,1}{(starry-eyed) dream} \iDM~lies in the exploration and design of \textbf{Sustainable Decentralized Trustworthy AI} platforms. Following are the topics I am actively working on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI for mechanism design~\A4M}: e.g., using data-driven methods to 
    improve the performance of economic platforms.
    \item \textbf{Mechanism design for AI~\M4A}: e.g., using economic incentives to 
    reinforce the efficiency and security of AI systems, especially on the blockchain platform.
    \item \textbf{Sustainability in AI \& Economy~\SUS}: e.g., using interdisciplinary
    methodologies to foster long-term social welfare and environmental friendliness
    for new-era AI and economic platforms. 
\end{itemize}

Additionally, I was interested in geometry-based computer vision (Visual SLAM in particular) at
my undergraduate times. Although I no longer focus on that research field, I am
still happy to discuss about related topics, especially the recently fruitful field of
Embodied AI~\EAI, and open to possible future interdisciplinary collaboration after my graduation.
