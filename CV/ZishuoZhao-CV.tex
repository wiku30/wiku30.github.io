\section*{Research Interest}

I am a PhD in UIUC, majoring in operations research. My general research interest lies in the incentive design for digital economy and AI platforms, with applications in both centralized and decentralized platforms.

I have a special interest in the mechanism design for blockchain and decentralized economics, with a \textcolor[rgb]{0.5,0.5,1}{(starry-eyed) dream}~\iDM on the exploration of the design and theoretical boundaries of \textbf{decentralized trustworthy AI} platforms, including (particularly) the current concern and initiative of \textbf{AI safety} for the upcoming AGI era.

Particularly, I am recently interested in the exploration into a novel paradigm of \emph{incentive security}
on blockchain and AI platforms, which aims to combine game-theoretic and systematic/cryptographic methodologies
to prevent dishonest behavior of \emph{untrusted but rational} parties.
