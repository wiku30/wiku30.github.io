\section*{Research Interest}

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in UIUC, majoring in operations research. My general research interest lies in the incentive design for digital economy and AI platforms, with applications in both centralized and decentralized platforms.

I have a special interest in the mechanism design for blockchain and decentralized economics, with a \textcolor[rgb]{0.5,0.5,1}{(starry-eyed) dream}~\iDM on the exploration of the design and theoretical boundaries of \textbf{decentralized trustworthy AI} platforms, including (particularly) the current concern and initiative of \textbf{AI safety} for the upcoming AGI era.

Particularly, I am recently interested in the exploration into a novel paradigm of \emph{incentive security}
on blockchain and AI platforms, which aims to combine game-theoretic and systematic/cryptographic methodologies
to prevent dishonest behavior of \emph{untrusted but rational} parties.
